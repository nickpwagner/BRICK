# History
## ~2000: Operational databases, SAP, Excel
- No single point of truth between databases
- Fast to read single entries, but not the entire data set (no analysis possible)
## ~2010: Data Warehouse / Business Intelligence
- DWH connect different systems via tables and are the single point of truth
- BI is the presentation and analysis of data
- all data is stored in a specific format
- complexity increases with amount of tables
## ~2014: [[Big Data]] / [[Data Lake]]
- provides far more use cases (**Variety**)
- handles large amounts of data (**Volume**)
- allows fast processing (**Velocity**)
## ~2016: Distributed Systems (Cloud)
- on-demand access to data processing and storage resources
- takes care of coordination effort needed to sync different nodes where 
- prevents vertical scaling and allows horizontal scaling
- **Challenges**: Fault Tolerance, Latency, Throughput

## ~2020 Production / AI 
- putting AI into production by operating and running AI platforms becomes important (MLOps, ...)
- improving software development (code creation, explanation, debugging, ...)
