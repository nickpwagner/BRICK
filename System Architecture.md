> High-level structure and design of a complex system, outlining its components, their relationships, and how they work together to achieve specific goals.
___
# Goal
- simplifying complex systems
- structuring the product and environment
- using these structures to support planning, developing, testing, ensuring safety and security
- making the structures on every system level complete to enable the engineers to detect gaps and inconsistencies
- creating focus by removing the superfluous information
- giving direction in unknown territory
# Stakeholders

> ....everyone
- **Project management:** 
   - Planning support With the help of function lists
   - Configuration definitions and technical breakdowns
- **Function Responsible:**
   - Active definition of the allocation along the modeled impact chains
   - Creation, moderation of DDDs based on models and leading it to a final decision
- **System Integration:** 
   - Active participation in system integration strategies based on technical decomposition
- **Requirements Engineering:** 
   - Ensuring the consistency of the specifications With the system building blocks
   - Traceability from customer to test for the system requirements affecting SysArch
- **System Test:** 
   - Ensuring the consistency of the system test strategy With regard to functional and technical breakdown
- **Software:**
   - clear coordination of model handover between system and SW, ensuring consistency
 - **Safety and Security:**
    - Ensure that the system architecture artifacts are taken into account in the respective concepts
    - Concepts are consistent with the system architecture
