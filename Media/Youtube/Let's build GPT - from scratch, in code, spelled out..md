- [01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=3970s) üß† Introduction to Self-Attention
  - Self-attention is a communication mechanism between nodes in a directed graph.
  - It's used to aggregate information in a data-dependent manner.
  - Self-attention is different from convolution, as it doesn't have a notion of space by default.

- [01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=4546s) üîÑ Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention
  - Self-attention involves keys, queries, and values from the same source.
  - Cross-attention involves keys and values from different sources, allowing nodes to interact with external information.
  - Both self-attention and cross-attention are types of attention mechanisms in Transformers.

- [01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=4684s) üìè Scaling in Scaled Attention
  - Scaling in self-attention involves dividing by the square root of the head size.

  - Scaled attention ensures that information is diffusely aggregated.

- [01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=4945s) ü§ù Multi-Head Self-Attention
  - Multi-head self-attention runs multiple attention heads in parallel.
  - Each head has its own communication channel and head size.
  - The outputs of these heads are concatenated over the channel dimension for diverse information gathering.

- [01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=5115s) üßê Introducing Feed-Forward Layers
  - Feed-forward layers provide per-token level computation.
  - They allow tokens to think individually on the gathered information.
  - The feed-forward layer in a Transformer is a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

- [01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=79s) üß© Overview of the Transformer Structure
  - The Transformer architecture is composed of blocks that alternate between communication and computation.
  - These blocks use multi-headed self-attention for communication and feed-forward networks for computation.
  - Key insight: Structuring the network this way helps avoid optimization problems in deep neural networks.

- [01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=1709s) üîÑ Skip Connections and Layer Normalization
  - Skip connections, also known as residual connections, come from a 2015 paper and help with deep network optimization.
  - Residual connections allow gradients to flow directly from the input to the output.
  - Layer normalization is similar to batch normalization but normalizes rows instead of columns, and it's a valuable technique for optimizing deep neural networks.

- [01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=2148s) ü§ñ Decoder-Only Transformer and Training Scalability
  - The model being built in the video is a decoder-only Transformer, meaning it doesn't include an encoder like the original Transformer paper.
  - The Triangular mask is used to create an autoregressive decoder, which is suitable for tasks like language modeling.
  - Scaling up the model involves changing hyperparameters, such as batch size, block size, and embedding dimensions, and introducing dropout for regularization.
  
- [01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=2789s) üì¶ Nano GPT Model Overview
  - Nano GPT consists of two main files: `train.py` for the training process and `model.py` for the Transformer model structure.
  - The `model.py` closely follows the Transformer architecture, but it handles multi-headed attention more efficiently in a single batched self-attention block.
  - The video's code implements a decoder-only Transformer similar to GPT models, which are primarily used for tasks like text generation.
