> Welcome back to Squat University. Last week I introduced a blog series on improving shoulder stability by addressing a weak serratus anterior muscle. This week we’re going to move on and discuss a few other important muscles: the rotator cuff, rhomboids and trapezius. Today I want to share with you a few exercises that will…

# Highlights

> Side-Lying External Rotation [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/stabilizing-the-shoulder-blade-joint-squat-university-18b854820fa#0809cd3d-01b0-4c29-ab22-0de57429df35)  ^0809cd3d

> Assume a side-lying position with a towel roll pinned between your top side arm and rib cage (this will help place your arm in the optimal position).1 Start with your arm parallel to the floor and shoulder blade pulled back and down (scapular retraction and depression). Without allowing your shoulder blade to move, pull your hand up towards the sky (the motion of external rotation) before returning back down.

> **Recommended sets/reps**: 2-3 sets of 15-20 reps [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/stabilizing-the-shoulder-blade-joint-squat-university-18b854820fa#443e39f0-2ca9-4869-82e9-e7b67f64a8f3)  ^443e39f0

> Banded “W” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/stabilizing-the-shoulder-blade-joint-squat-university-18b854820fa#f054c5fd-893a-4ea3-b2c6-7ef8c3f814b7)  ^f054c5fd

> This progression from the previous Side-Lying External Rotation exercise not only addresses rotator cuff strength and stability but also activates the often underutilized lower portion of the trapezius muscle.
