# Aspects (OOSC2 Meyer)
## Decomposability
- divide and conquer
- divide a SW problem into small number of less complex sub-problems 
## Composability
- degree to which modules can be combined to form more complex systems.
## Protection
- freedom from interference 
- abnormal conditions at run time in a module remain confined to that module
## Understandability
- each module is understandable on its own
## Continuity
- small change in the specification will trigger a change in one or few modules
# Benefits
- higher quality
- testability
- flexibility
- analyzability
- scalability
- interchangeability
- responsibility
- reliability
- reuse
- master complexity
- adaptability
- configurability
- extendability
- portability
- better collaboration and 
- smoother deployment
