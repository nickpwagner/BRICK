- subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions from data
- involves training models on data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends, allowing the system to generalize and make predictions on new, unseen data
- applied in various domains, including classification, regression, clustering, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems

Data Preparation
- For Algorithms that work with distances: Standardization vs. Normalization 

  Correlation
  - linear relationship between variables (-1 - 1)
  - between sample and ground truth
	  - if correlation= $|1|$ ,good variable to predict the other for linear regression
  - between features
	  - if correlation=1, then we can remove the other variable because knowing one you know the other (redundant)
